Attempted the API test, I apologise if its not exactly what you was looking for
im still currently learning how to understand/build API's from self
study but i did my best to complete the task.

Created an API in MVC format.

User will be able to add a new episode, update an episode and delete one.

Users will also be able to view a list of all the different episodes
and has an additional feature of rating it.

Added authentication with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to
make the API more secure.
