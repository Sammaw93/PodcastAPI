Apologies for missing out the S3 task i've never used it before so was unsure on how to tackle this with no experience and wanting to submit ASAP due to not knowing the test deadline.

I've attempted this section of the task by self teaching and learning how it works this morning, i've added code to connect to a cloud server using Digital Ocean Spaces you should be able to see the added code within the added changes.
I also tried attempting to add a button on the view page to upload a file from file explorer to store into the space but was having problems and was confused and unsure on how to do so.





Created an API in MVC format.

User will be able to add a new episode, update an episode and delete one.

Users will also be able to view a list of all the different episodes
and has an additional feature of rating it.

Added authentication with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to
make the API more secure.
